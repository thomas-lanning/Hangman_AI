# Hangman_AI
Many iterations for a hangman AI which I trained for a coding interview

It starts off for 2 letter using reinforcement learning and then uses a GPT to guess the remaining letters.
I used a GPT instance to try guess the hangman words to try something different...
Cannot include the model path files nor the word list since they want it to be kept confidential.
